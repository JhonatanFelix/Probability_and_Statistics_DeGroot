# Probability and Statistics, DeGroot
 

The objective of this repository is to write my numerical notes and observations about the topics I'm reviewing of Probability and Statistics. For me, this book is a great source of knowledge and instruction to the basics principles of probability and a good introduction to advanced statistics.
